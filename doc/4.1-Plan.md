# CS 1440 Assignment 4.1: Software Development Plan

## Phase 0: Requirements Analysis (tag name `4.1-analyzed`)
*(20% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

*   [ ] Re-write the instructions in your own words.
    *   If you don't do this, you won't know what you're supposed to do!
    *   Don't leave out details!

For this assignments, I'll be taking the existing code and refactoring it using principles of
object-oriented design, meaning things will be reorganized into classes. Some, like Palette and Fractal, will
be abstract with subclasses.
Some things (Fractal Factory, Fractal Parser) can be methods in modules.
ImagePainter will become a class. An instance will be created after other methods have been called and will take their products.

I'll be writing a new user's manual as well, since the UI will be changing. No arguments will return a default palette and
fractal, rather than options, so the manual is the only place to give direction.

*   [ ] Explain the problem this program aims to solve.
    *   Describe what a *good* solution looks like.
    *   List what you already know how to do.
    *   Point out any challenges that you can foresee.
*   [ ] List all of the data that is used by the program, making note of where it comes from.
    *   Explain what form the output will take.
  
The program will take at most two arguments from the command line - one fractal name and one color palette name.

The program will have a default fractal hard coded in that will be printed if no arguments are given, but otherwise
fractal data will come from files matching the fractal names given.

* [ ] List the algorithms that will be used (but don't write them yet).
* [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-analyzed` and push it to GitLab.
    *   *Grace Points: if this tag is pushed before class on the Monday before the due date, you will receive up to 5 points back*


## Phase 1: Design (tag name `4.1-designed`)
*(30% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

*   [ ] Function signatures that include:
    *   Descriptive names.
    *   Parameter lists.
    *   Documentation strings that explain its purpose and types of inputs and outputs.
*   [ ] Pseudocode that captures how each function works.
    *   Pseudocode != source code.  Do not paste your finished source code into this part of the plan.
*   Explain what happens in the face of good and bad input.
    *   Write a few specific examples that occur to you, and use them later when testing.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-designed` and push it to GitLab.
    *   *Grace Points: if this tag is pushed before class on the Monday before the due date, you will receive up to 5 points back*

### Palette
    abstract class
    initializes with an empty list. might try to write a method that will generate the palette given colors in subclasses, 
    might just do that in the subclasses.
    getcolor()
    raises exception if Palette is called, rather than subclase (take the error from the requirements page)

#### Palette subclass 1 - sunrise
    use colour.color to generate a palette between colors 
    (follow palette.py example from class)
    use 4C14F (purple), 3E92CC (blue), FEE1C7 (cream), FA7E61 (orange), F44174 (pink)
    
    getcolor(n)
    takes an integer (iteration count) as input and returns a hex code
    iteration count will correspond to a color from the palette (call the nth color in the list)
    Color.get_hex_l() will return a hex code

#### Palette subclass 2 - thunderstorm
    create a palette using colour.color
    same as above with different colors
    0D1B2A (dark blue), EFA00B (yellow), 415A77 (blue-gray),
    50D8D7 (aqua), E01DD (light gray)

### PaletteFactory
    import Palette (and subclasses)
    module with a method
    instantiates palette object according to commands from user

    makePalette(paletteName, fractalInfo)
        return an instance of the requested palette, given iteration count and name
    
    if no palette name is given, return a default palette (sunrise)

    if they ask for a palette that doesnt exist, raise a NotImplemented Error.


### ImagePainter
    import tkinter
    convert to a class
    constructor takes products from FractalFactory, PaletteFactory, and FractalParser
    paint and statusbar can be methods still,with some tweaks to look at self rather than parameters.

### Fractal
    abstract class
    count()
        raises NotImplemented if called
#### Subclasses
Mandelbrot and Phoenix will be converted into classes.
Both implement count()
* takes a complex number as input and returns iteration count
* other data supplied through self reference
2 more:

### FractalFactory
    module with a function
    import Fractal derived classes
    makeFracta(fractalInfo)
        return a concrete fractal object, given its info
    if no info is given, return a harcoded default fractal dictionary

### FractalParser
    module with a method
    takes the fractal name given on the commands line and opens the corresponding .frac file
    take the data from that file and converts to a dictionary
    
    for line in file:
    convert each line to lowercase
    split lines into two
    first part of line = last part of line

    raise NotImplementedError if an unrecognized fractal type is encountered.

### unit test ideas
* verify that FractalParser returns a dictionary with the correct items
* verify that count() always returns an int

## Phase 2: Implementation (tag name `4.1-implemented`)
*(15% of your effort)*

**Finally, you can write code!**

Deliver:

*   [ ] More or less working code.
*   [ ] Note any relevant and interesting events that happened while you wrote the code.
    *   e.g. things you learned, things that didn't go according to plan.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-implemented` and push it to GitLab.


## Phase 3: Testing and Debugging (tag name `4.1-tested`)
*(30% of your effort)*

Deliver:

*   [ ] A set of test cases that you have personally run on your computer.
    *   Include a description of what happened for each test case.
    *   For any bugs discovered, describe their cause and remedy.
    *   Write your test cases in plain language such that a non-coder could run them and replicate your experience.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-tested` and push it to GitLab.


## Phase 4: Deployment (tag name `4.1-deployed`)
*(5% of your effort)*

Deliver:

*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-deployed` and push it to GitLab.
*   [ ] Your repository is pushed to GitLab.
*   [ ] **Verify** that your final commit was received by browsing to its project page on GitLab.
    *   Ensure the project's URL is correct.
    *   Look for all of the tags in the **Tags** tab.
    *   Review the project to ensure that all required files are present and in correct locations.
    *   Check that unwanted files have not been included.
    *   Make any final touches to documentation, including the Sprint Signature and this Plan.
*   [ ] **Validate** that your submission is complete and correct by cloning it to a new location on your computer and re-running it.
	*	Run your program from the command line so you can see how it will behave when your grader runs it.  **Running it in PyCharm is not good enough!**
    *   Run through your test cases to avoid nasty surprises.
    *   Check that your documentation files are all present.


## Phase 5: Maintenance

Spend a few minutes writing thoughtful answers to these questions.  They are meant to make you think about the long-term consequences of choices you made in this project.

Deliver:

*   [ ] Write brief and honest answers to these questions:
    *   What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?
        *   Are there parts of your program which you aren't quite sure how/why they work?
        *   If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?
    *   Will your documentation make sense to...
        *   ...anybody besides yourself?
        *   ...yourself in six month's time?
    *   How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?
    *   Will your program continue to work after upgrading...
        *   ...your computer's hardware?
        *   ...the operating system?
        *   ...to the next version of Python?
*   [ ] Make one final commit and push your **completed** Software Development Plan to GitLab.
*   [ ] Respond to the **Assignment Reflection Survey** on Canvas.
