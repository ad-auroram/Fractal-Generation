# CS 1440 Assignment 4.0: Software Development Plan

## Phase 0: Requirements Analysis (tag name `4.0-analyzed`)
*(20% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

*   [ ] Re-write the instructions in your own words.
    *   If you don't do this, you won't know what you're supposed to do!
    *   Don't leave out details!
*   [ ] Explain the problem this program aims to solve.
    *   Describe what a *good* solution looks like.
  *   List what you already know how to do.
  *   Point out any challenges that you can foresee.
*   [ ] List all of the data that is used by the program, making note of where it comes from.
    *   Explain what form the output will take.
*   [ ] List the algorithms that will be used (but don't write them yet).
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.0-analyzed` and push it to GitLab.
    *   *Grace Points: if this tag is pushed before class on the Monday before the due date, you will receive up to 5 points back*


Refactor an existing python program, which means to go through and make it cleaner and easier to read. I'll be identifying "code smells"
(code that doesn't necessarily crash anything but is not good to look at) and rewriting the functions so the smells are gone.

There should be no difference on the user end once I'm done, but the code will be much easier to understand.

***Things I know:***
* how to make modules in python (and how to import)
* running unit tests
* can probably write a user's manual

***Things I don't know yet:***
* how to write good unit tests
* not very familiar with global variables (or how to get rid of them)
* tkinter

The code uses a dictionary of dictionaries to keep track of the different fractals. It also contains a big list of colors 
(that get repeated in each module as of now, which will be fixed). The dictionaries will also be reorganized into just one dictionary.
The program takes arguments from the command line, and uses the first argument after the filename to find the correct fractal in the dictionary.

Output takes the form of a window opening and displaying the image (uses a for loop to go pixel by pixel), and then the png being saved.

## Phase 1: Design (tag name `4.0-designed`)
*(30% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

*   [ ] Function signatures that include:
    *   Descriptive names.
    *   Parameter lists.
    *   Documentation strings that explain its purpose and types of inputs and outputs.
*   [ ] Pseudocode that captures how each function works.
    *   Pseudocode != source code.  Do not paste your finished source code into this part of the plan.
*   Explain what happens in the face of good and bad input.
    *   Write a few specific examples that occur to you, and use them later when testing.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.0-designed` and push it to GitLab.
    *   *Grace Points: if this tag is pushed before class on the Monday before the due date, you will receive up to 5 points back*

### Fractal Information
Create a dictionary with all fractal configuration data.
Additional key to differentiate between phoenix and mandelbrot.

### Palette
Create two arrays of colors.


### Image Painter
Create a window and a PhotoImage object, given the fractal type/information
```commandline
import tkinter

create window
loop though x and y coordinates
    get the color for each one (call fractal algorithms, Palette[fractal(x,y)]
save png
```

### Phoenix
Given x and y coordinates of the complex plane, return iteration count.
```commandline
phoenixIteration(x,y):
for i in len(palette)
        do the math stuff (i think it's converting a complex number into a real number. I'll take his math and 
        try to make it easier to understand by giving better variable names)
        loop stops if the absolute value is greater than 2
    return i
```

### Mandelbrot
Given x and y coordinates of the complex plane, return iteration count.
```commandline
mandelbrotIteration(x,y):
    for i in len(palette)
        do the math stuff
        loop stops once absolute value reaches 2
    return i
```

### main
```commandline
error if arguments are invalid, show error message and quit
call image painter with the fractal information given
```

## Phase 2: Implementation (tag name `4.0-implemented`)
*(15% of your effort)*

**Finally, you can write code!**

Deliver:

*   [ ] More or less working code.
*   [ ] Note any relevant and interesting events that happened while you wrote the code.
    *   e.g. things you learned, things that didn't go according to plan.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.0-implemented` and push it to GitLab.


## Phase 3: Testing and Debugging (tag name `4.0-tested`)
*(30% of your effort)*

Deliver:

*   [ ] A set of test cases that you have personally run on your computer.
    *   Include a description of what happened for each test case.
    *   For any bugs discovered, describe their cause and remedy.
    *   Write your test cases in plain language such that a non-coder could run them and replicate your experience.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.0-tested` and push it to GitLab.


## Phase 4: Deployment (tag name `4.0-deployed`)
*(5% of your effort)*

Deliver:

*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.0-deployed` and push it to GitLab.
*   [ ] Your repository is pushed to GitLab.
*   [ ] **Verify** that your final commit was received by browsing to its project page on GitLab.
    *   Ensure the project's URL is correct.
    *   Look for all of the tags in the **Tags** tab.
    *   Review the project to ensure that all required files are present and in correct locations.
    *   Check that unwanted files have not been included.
    *   Make any final touches to documentation, including the Sprint Signature and this Plan.
*   [ ] **Validate** that your submission is complete and correct by cloning it to a new location on your computer and re-running it.
	*	Run your program from the command line so you can see how it will behave when your grader runs it.  **Running it in PyCharm is not good enough!**
    *   Run through your test cases to avoid nasty surprises.
    *   Check that your documentation files are all present.


## Phase 5: Maintenance

Spend a few minutes writing thoughtful answers to these questions.  They are meant to make you think about the long-term consequences of choices you made in this project.

Deliver:

*   [ ] Write brief and honest answers to these questions:
    *   What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?
        *   Are there parts of your program which you aren't quite sure how/why they work?
        *   If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?
    *   Will your documentation make sense to...
        *   ...anybody besides yourself?
        *   ...yourself in six month's time?
    *   How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?
    *   Will your program continue to work after upgrading...
        *   ...your computer's hardware?
        *   ...the operating system?
        *   ...to the next version of Python?
*   [ ] Make one final commit and push your **completed** Software Development Plan to GitLab.
*   [ ] Respond to the **Assignment Reflection Survey** on Canvas.
